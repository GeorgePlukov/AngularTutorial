# AngularTutorial
This is a tutorial for how to start an angular project from the ground up. It will take you through creating and configuring a project, launching your web app and the basics of AngularJs. This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of html and css, knowing some javascript will help but the relevant portions will be covered. 

## Getting started
If you dont have Node.js installed (we will be using npm) go to https://nodejs.org/download/ and download/install the relevant version for your computer.

Once Node.js is installed type

``npm -v``


into your command prompt to make sure npm installed properly. If you installed Node and there is no response from the npm command try closing and reopening your console.
